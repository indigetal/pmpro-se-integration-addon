# pmpro-se-integration-addon
Integration to monetize SpacesEngine using Paid Memberships Pro and a selection of its addons.

See full tutorial for how to implement this integration https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUryaySNlipWDN94GGSoT0peftSB-Ac3LzNo3CCkXEU/edit?usp=sharing

Next stage of the project is to develop a settings page for the WordPress backend. SpacesEngine is currently working on functionality to enable and disable specific features of SpacesEngine. That functionality is also planned to be implemented in the integration and configurable in PMPro's level settings when it becomes available.
